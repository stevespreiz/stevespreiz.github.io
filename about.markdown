My name is Steven Spreizer. I'm a master's student in aeronautical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as a part of the Scientific Computation Research Center ([SCOREC][scorec-github]).
I completed my bachelor's also at RPI in aeronautical and mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science. 

I'm a runner and compete on the NCAA D3 cross country and track & field teams at RPI. Other hobbies I have include photography, cooking, and building projects, many of which are featured on this site. 

I hope you enjoy the content I've put together here. You can find out more about me on my [LinkedIn][linkedin-site] and can see my code and software projects I've worked on over on my [GitHub][github-link].
